/*
 * heapsort.h --
 *
 * Implements in-place sorting of an array of values or objects by heap-sort
 * algorithm.  Adapted from "Numerical Recipes in C" (W.H. Press,
 * B.P. Flannery, S.A. Teukolsky and W.T. Vetterling, Cambridge University
 * Press).
 *
 * Two different kinds of routines are obtained by defining some macros prior
 * to include this file.  These macros are:
 *
 *   HEAPSORT_SCOPE        - scope of the heap-sort routine (optional,
 *                           "static" by default);
 *   HEAPSORT_FUNCTION     - name of the heap-sort routine (must be defined);
 *   HEAPSORT_OBJ_TYPE     - data type of objects to sort (must be defined);
 *   HEAPSORT_KEY_TYPE     - data type of sort key (optional, see below);
 *   HEAPSORT_GET_KEY(obj) - macro to get the sorting key of object OBJ
 *                           (optional, see below).
 *
 * The prototype of the function will be:
 *
 *   HEAPSORT_SCOPE void HEAPSORT_FUNCTION(HEAPSORT_OBJ_TYPE obj[], size_t n);
 *
 * To sort an array of values, only HEAPSORT_FUNCTION and HEAPSORT_OBJ_TYPE
 * have to be defined.  For instance, the following preprocessor instructions
 * will insert the code of a private (static) routine "sort_long" which
 * performs in-place sorting of an array of long integers:
 *
 *   #define HEAPSORT_SCOPE      static
 *   #define HEAPSORT_FUNCTION   sort_long
 *   #define HEAPSORT_OBJ_TYPE   long
 *   #include "heapsort.h"
 *
 * To sort an array of arbitrarily complex objects, the macros
 * HEAPSORT_KEY_TYPE and HEAPSORT_GET_KEY must be also defined.  For instance,
 * the following preprocessor instructions will insert the code of a public
 * routine "sort_foo" which performs in-place sorting of an array of objects
 * of type foo_t according to the value of their "weight" member:
 *
 *   #define HEAPSORT_SCOPE         extern "C"
 *   #define HEAPSORT_FUNCTION      sort_foo
 *   #define HEAPSORT_OBJ_TYPE      foo_t *
 *   #define HEAPSORT_KEY_TYPE      double
 *   #define HEAPSORT_GET_KEY(obj)  (obj)->weight
 *   #include "heapsort.h"
 *
 * The following example is for sorting an array of pointer to objects of type
 * foo_t (note the differences with the previous example):
 *
 *   #define HEAPSORT_SCOPE         extern "C"
 *   #define HEAPSORT_FUNCTION      sort_foo
 *   #define HEAPSORT_OBJ_TYPE      foo_t
 *   #define HEAPSORT_KEY_TYPE      double
 *   #define HEAPSORT_GET_KEY(obj)  (obj).weight
 *   #include "heapsort.h"
