                              YImage
                              ******

YImage is a Yorick plugin for image-like operations.  As far as possible
Yorick arrays are interpreted as images: numerical 2D array are grayscale
images, 3-by-WIDTH-by-HEIGHT char arrays are RGB images (of dimensions WIDTH
and HEIGHT), and 4-by-WIDTH-by-HEIGHT char arrays are RGBA images (red, green,
blue, alpha).

This version provides:

 - basic image management: is_image, img_is_complex, img_is_color img_is_rgb,
          img_is_rgba, img_get_height, img_get_width, img_get_type,
          img_get_red, img_get_green, img_get_blue, img_get_alpha,
          img_get_channel

 - linear transform of the coordinate of an image: img_extract_rectangle,
          img_rotate ;

 - morpho-math operations: img_morph_black_top_hat img_morph_closing,
          img_morph_dilation, img_morph_enhance, img_morph_erosion,
          img_morph_lmin_lmax, img_morph_opening, img_morph_trilevel,
          img_morph_white_top_hat;

 - image segmentation (see img_segmentation_new);

 - functions to manage pools of chains of image segments (see img_chainpool_new

 - pixelwise comparison of images (see img_cost_l2);

 - estimate the noise level in an image (see img_estimate_noise)

 - miscellaneous functions: img_define_constant, img_get_symbol,
          img_get_version;


INSTALLATION
============

Installation is done in a few steps: (1) unpack the archive, (2) make a build
directory, (3) configure for compilation, (4) build the plug-in and (5) install
it:

    tar jxvf YImage-$VERSION.tar.bz2
    mkdir -p $BUILD
    cd $BUILD
    $SRCDIR/configure
    make clean
    make
    make install

where `$VERSION` yields the version number, `$BUILD` yields the build directory
and `$SRCDIR` yields the top directory where are the plugin sources.  The build
directory can be anywhere, including inside the directory tree of the plugin
source.  The `configure` script has some options which are listed with:

    configure --help


INSTALLATION (THE OLD WAY)
==========================

Unpack the archive, then update the Makefile, build the plug-in and install it
(`$VERSION` yields the version number):

    tar jxvf YImage-$VERSION.tar.bz2
    cd YImage-$VERSION
    yorick -batch make.i
    make clean
    make
    make install

QUICK START
===========

To use the plugin, just load "image.i" (all functions provided by the plugin
are prefixed with "img_" and global constant names are prefixed with "IMG_"):

   yorick
   > include, "image.i";
   > help, img_get_width
